I'm not fully sure how to begin this, so, I'll try to take it as pragmatically as I can.

As you are all probably aware by now my name is Gustavo. I'm 36 years old now. Even though for most of my professional career I have worked alongside the technology industry in several of its related niches, this is the *first time* I've embarked full-time on a software engineering / development job opportunity, at [GlobalLogic](http://www.globallogic.com). Yes, I have had freelance experiences as a developer, but never under the brace of full responsibility, teamwork and the structures and conventions they imply.

## What did this all mean for me? 

Well, at this point it would be safe to say it was about time to stop embracing my comfort zone. Working fourteen years into the Digital Marketing industry, especially in management positions for at least 6-7 years, I had a somehow fully fledged plan for everything. From the start. How to present yourself at interviews, what your A-B-C plans would be in most situations, how to handle your times and so on. 
It was safe to say I had some aspects of the position *fully pegged*.

And yet, somehow, a while ago, I began to feel stuck at my position and my work. Don't get me wrong, Marketing is just a good a profession as any. But for reasons sometimes in myself but mostly outside of myself (dimming performances by advertising platforms, impossibility to rank properly in Search Engines and so on, because there were many reasons), I began to feel I needed a change for one reason, to keep myself motivated, and to go for what had been mostly a private passion that had slowly become a freelance profession as well. As a web developer. 

But, --hell-- I was starting at it at 36. So dangerously close to the edge. Why hadn't I realized this when I was 26? 23? Is there any space for us near-to-be-dinosaurs (not really, we're still riding the digital wave somehow, but you can begin to feel the distance between our side of the wave and the young people riding the crest right now). At 36 you're not even remotely dead, that's for sure, but you're not feeling anew as if you were 20 and the obligations and capabilities the body and mind have are somehow different than when you were on your twenties.

Heck, for an example, sometimes (most times), friday nights become an excuse to skip the pints and parties, and go straight to bed. Yes, I've become an old guy. This wouldn't even have been a possibility while being younger. 

>> This will probably become a long series so I'll try to dish it out in different posts for various 
>> purposes and processes.

### First steps, baby steps. Get stepping.

Ok. So you've decided to make a change. I decided on it before this, as well. I decided that by keeping in my previous job position I would simply get stuck, and I would probably get demotivated too.

### Try to embrace change as much as you can

### Embrace the age-change

### Dance (or play your fiddle like Nero!) over Impostor Syndrome's symptoms.
