## Malamud.dev

Hi, this is my website. As [my profile](http://github.com/gusma/) states, I'm a developer.

This repo in particular is meant to store my personal / professional website, plus/minus show any mods or implementations I should have made to said website. That said, except for the contents of it, feel free to check out anything that may be helpful to use to use with your implementation. Good luck!
